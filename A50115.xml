            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

               <pb n="6" facs="tcp:33759:5"/> Day, but PRAYER? It is the <hi>Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>calar</hi> verse of that Psalm, which runs over the chief Concernments of Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Life, Psal. 107.6, 13, 19, 28. <hi>Then they cried unto the Lord in their Trouble, and He delivered them out of their Distresses.</hi> Truly all our Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernments do at all Times call for such <hi>Intercalations;</hi> but especially at these Times, when we may say, with the Dying Martyr, <hi>Pray, Pray, Pray, never more need than Now!</hi> The Great God, is now doing of those things, whereof He says unto us, as in <hi>Amos</hi> 4.12. <hi>Because I will do this, prepare to meet thy God, O Israel:</hi> But in what posture dare we meet our God, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less in <hi>Prayer</hi> upon our Knees? There are several <hi>Keys</hi> of our Welfare; I do not mention the Jewish Enumeration of them, for there are more than <hi>Four</hi> of those <hi>Keys,</hi> which the God of Heaven still keeps in His own Hands. We have extraordinary oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casions for the Turning of those <hi>Keys;</hi> but it is <hi>Prayer</hi> that must Jog the Infinite Hand, which has the
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:33759:5"/> Turning of them. Briefly, we are in a Time, of Difficulties, wherein we can have none but <hi>Refuges of Lies,</hi> except we do in Truth come unto, that Experience, in Psal. 34.6. <hi>This poor man cry'd, and the Lord heard him, and saved him out of all his Troubles.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Well then, To Quicken both our Godly <hi>Fear,</hi> and our Fervent <hi>Prayer,</hi> I have now Read you a <hi>Text,</hi> which cannot be unseasonable.</p>
            <p>One of <hi>Jobs</hi> Comforters, is here managing a Disputation against that Afflicted Saint, wherein, methinks, he deals but roughly with him; thereunto Instigated, no doubt, by misunderstanding certain passages in the Discourse of <hi>Job.</hi> It is the Lot of many a <hi>good man,</hi> to have many an <hi>Ill Charge</hi> injuriously made upon him. <hi>Defamations,</hi> the fruit of <hi>mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>constructions,</hi> are among the most usual Trials of the Innocent. Holy <hi>Job</hi> is here charged, first, with <hi>Speaking</hi> unwisely, then, with <hi>Acting</hi> wickedly. As to the <hi>Latter,</hi> in our
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:33759:6"/> Text, he is Indicted, for Neglecting both the <hi>Inward</hi> and the <hi>Outward</hi> Worship of God. <hi>Fear,</hi> is by a <hi>Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>necdoche</hi> put for all the <hi>Inward,</hi> and <hi>Prayer,</hi> by a like <hi>Synecdoche</hi> put for all the <hi>Outward.</hi> The style of our Text, is indeed so Oriental, that we might as lawfully as usefully, il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lustrate it, with a very various <hi>Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phrase.</hi> But we shall confine our selves to the sense most obvious in our own Translation.</p>
            <p>The first Article of the Charge is, <hi>Thou Castest off Fear.</hi> By that <hi>Fear</hi> is meant Eminently, <hi>The Fear of God.</hi> When we say, <hi>The VVord,</hi> we use to mean, <hi>The Word of God;</hi> as if there were no <hi>Word</hi> but <hi>Gods;</hi> for indeed there is none so considerable as that <hi>Word.</hi> Thus, <hi>The Fear,</hi> here spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of, may note, <hi>The Fear of God;</hi> inasmuch as there is no <hi>Fear</hi> to be like that, wherewith we are to <hi>Fear</hi> Him who can <hi>Cast both Body and Soul into Hell.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <gap reason="illegible" resp="#murp" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>â€¢</desc>
               </gap>ut in the mean time, what <hi>ground</hi> for this Charge? I answer, The
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:33759:6"/> Charge seems grounded on those Expressions, of <hi>Job,</hi> wherein he complains, That <hi>the Righteous are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroyed with the Wicked,</hi> and, That <hi>the Tabernacles of Robbers prosper.</hi> Or, on those, wherein his Challenges made unto the most <hi>High</hi> God, have a sort of peremptoriness, not agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to that <hi>Lowliness</hi> of mind, with which the <hi>Fear of God</hi> would cause us to speak of all His Managements. Wherefore some of the Ancient and Eastern Versions carry it, as if it were here intimated that <hi>Job</hi> had been speaking to God, without the <hi>Modesty</hi> that became a poor Worm of the Dust!</p>
            <p>The Second Article of the Charge is, <hi>Thou Restrainest Prayer before God.</hi> What is here Translated <hi>Prayer,</hi> is promiscuously to be Englished, either <hi>Meditation,</hi> or <hi>Supplication;</hi> and indeed, those are such <hi>Twins</hi> that the same Name would well befit both of them; one of them would still be Insignificant without the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; I may say of them, <hi>They
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:33759:7"/> are Lovely and Pleasant in their Lives, and in their Deaths they are not Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But again, What <hi>ground</hi> for this Charge? I answer, The Writers a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the <hi>Jews</hi> tell us, That the Charge is grounded on those Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressions of <hi>Job,</hi> that seemed a Denial of <hi>Providence.</hi> To Deny <hi>Providence,</hi> is to Extinguish <hi>Prayer,</hi> for ever. Men will not be the <hi>Diligent seekers of God,</hi> except they Believe that <hi>God is a Rewarder of them who diligently seek him.</hi> Men will soon <hi>Leave off</hi> the <hi>seeking</hi> of God, if they don't Believe that God will <hi>cut off</hi> them that <hi>seek</hi> Him not. Now <hi>Jobs</hi> Assertions, as taken, yea, mistaken, would yield such Consequences, as this, That <hi>Prayer</hi> is to be <hi>Restrained,</hi> that is, Withdrawn, and Lessened, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God.</p>
            <p>But let all issue then in this Lesson
<q>That Prayer may not be Restrain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, Fear must not be Rejected.</q>

            <p>When was it that <hi>Jacob</hi> set him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self to Wrestle with the <hi>mighty God of Jacob?</hi> It was when, as we read, in Gen. 32.7. <hi>He was greatly Afraid and Distressed.</hi> When was it that <hi>Jehoshaphat</hi> not only called upon the God of <hi>Judah</hi> himself, but called upon all <hi>Judah</hi> to do so too? We read in 2 Chron. 20.3. <hi>He Feared, and set himself to seek the Lord, and proclaimed a Fast.</hi> It is written of <hi>Hezekiah,</hi> in Jer. 26.19. <hi>Did he not Fear the Lord, and Besought the Face of the Lord?</hi> It is the <hi>Fear</hi> of God, which is to put men upon seeking the <hi>Face</hi> of God; for which, there are two <hi>Propositions</hi> which now de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand a room in your Considerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</p>

               <p>PRAYER to God is a Duty to be by no means <hi>Restrained</hi> among the Children of men. As for <hi>Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,</hi> 'tis indeed such a <hi>Moral</hi> Duty, that they who are sunk into the deepest Abyss of <hi>Immorality,</hi> will

               <p>There is not only the Light of <hi>Scripture,</hi> Enforcing this Duty, but there is the Light of <hi>Nature</hi> too. 'Tis said, in Jer. 10.25. <hi>Pour out thy Fury on the Heathen, that know thee not, and on the Families that call not on thy Name.</hi> So that the <hi>Heathen</hi> themselves, who <hi>Know</hi> not God a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right, yet Sin against the Light of what <hi>Knowledge</hi> they have, when they do not <hi>Call on the Name of God.</hi> It is the <hi>Law</hi> of our <hi>Creation,</hi> that we should pray to God as our <hi>Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>server,</hi> no less than our <hi>Creator;</hi> and so <hi>Engraven</hi> is this <hi>Law</hi> in the Heart of every Rational <hi>Creature,</hi> that the most <hi>Lawless</hi> Nations of men, count it the most <hi>Rational</hi> Thing imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble for them, to wait upon their Creator with their <hi>Devotions.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It will only be expected that we now answer two Enquiries.</p>
               <div n="1" type="question">
                  <head>
                     <hi>The First Enquiry.</hi> What is the Prayer that must have no Restraint?</head>
                  <pb n="13" facs="tcp:33759:8"/>
                  <p>I Answer, PRAYER, is <hi>the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senting of our Desire to God in Christ, for His Mercy, in his Time and His Way, and His Measure, to be obtained.</hi> That we may speak yet more di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinctly.</p>
                  <p>First, The <hi>Object</hi> of Prayer, is GOD in CHRIST. It were a detestable <hi>Idolatry</hi> to make a proper <hi>Prayer,</hi> (which is, <hi>The Acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of a first cause</hi>) unto any be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides that <hi>God,</hi> whose Name alone is JEHOVAH, the Infinite and E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal <hi>First Cause</hi> of all Things; a <hi>Daniel</hi> would sooner be torn to pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces with Hungry Lions, and the <hi>Children</hi> of God would sooner broil to Death in the Furnace heated by the <hi>Type</hi> of Antichrist, than commit such an <hi>Idolatry.</hi> It is the Rule in Math. 4.10. <hi>Thou shalt worship the Lord thy God, and Him only thou shalt serve;</hi> and the Devil himself could not gainsay that Rule. Who should be the <hi>Object</hi> of Prayer, but the <hi>Hearer</hi> of Prayer? Now the <hi>Hearer</hi> of Prayer, must needs be an <hi>Omni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>present</hi>
                     <pb n="14" facs="tcp:33759:9"/> One, able at once to receive the Supplications of many Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sands from all Quarters of the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse; and He must be an <hi>Omnipo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent</hi> One, able to Rescue all, to Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply all, the miserable. But there is none besides our God, <hi>Who fills Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven and Earth;</hi> none besides our God, <hi>For whom nothing is too hard;</hi> and hence This our God challenges it as His Title, in Psal. 65.2. <hi>O Thou Hearer of Prayer!</hi> Why so? Because 'tis <hi>He</hi> alone, to whom we may say, <hi>O Thou Helper of men!</hi> Yea, but This God is not now to be Addres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed from sinful men, but in and by and through the Lord Jesus <gap reason="illegible" resp="#murp" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>HRIST. He that is the <hi>Truth,</hi> hath with <hi>it</hi> said unto us, in Joh. 14.6. <hi>I am the VVay; no man comes unto the Father but by me.</hi> As the Lord of <hi>Egypt</hi> said unto the Sons of <hi>Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cob, Ye shall not see my Face, except ye bring your Brother with you:</hi> So does the King of Heaven say to all the Seed of <hi>Jacob,</hi> I mean, <hi>The Genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of them that seek Him;</hi> He saith,
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:33759:9"/>
                     <hi>I will not Look upon you, unless you bring your Jesus with you.</hi> What are we to do with our <hi>Prayer?</hi> we have an <hi>Angel</hi> in Heaven, the Great Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>created <hi>Angel of the Covenant,</hi> unto whom we must carry and commit the <hi>Incense</hi> of our Prayer; yea, our Prayer will be no <hi>Incense,</hi> but the rank, filthy, lothsome <hi>Nidor,</hi> of the <hi>Flesh,</hi> which attends all our Sacrifices, will make our <hi>Prayer</hi> become an <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bomination</hi> unto Him who dwells in the <hi>Holy of Holies,</hi> except this Blessed <hi>Angel</hi> perfume it, with his Intercessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. We read in Rev. 8.4. <hi>The Smoke of the Incense which came with the Prayers of the Saints, ascended up before God, out of the Angels Hand. Prayer</hi> was of old made with an Eye towards the <hi>Temple;</hi> Why, 'tis the Lord Jesus Christ who is the true <hi>Temple</hi> of God; it is in Him that <hi>there dwells the Fulness of the God-Head Bodily.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, For the <hi>Nature</hi> of Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, 'Tis, <hi>A presenting of our Desire.</hi> In every Prayer, there is the <hi>Desire</hi>
                     <pb n="16" facs="tcp:33759:10"/> of some Good Thing; yea, but something more than such a <hi>Desire</hi> is also requisite; it must be a <hi>Desire</hi> some how brought forth unto the Lord. <hi>Prayer</hi> is that, whereof 'tis said in Phil. 4.6. <hi>Let your Requests be made known unto God.</hi> Sometimes the <hi>Desire</hi> becomes a <hi>Prayer</hi> only in our <hi>Minds:</hi> the silent out-goings of the <hi>Soul</hi> and <hi>Will</hi> to God, are a most speaking Prayer. A <hi>Prayer</hi> may be made with <hi>Unuttered Groans,</hi> yea, with <hi>Unutterables.</hi> Thus 'tis said, in Lam. 3.41. <hi>Let us Lift up our Heart unto God in the Heavens.</hi> This is indeed the main Ingredient of every <hi>Prayer;</hi> 'tis the most <hi>Omi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous</hi> Defect of any Prayer, when the <hi>Heart</hi> shall be found wanting there. But sometimes also the <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire</hi> becomes a <hi>Prayer</hi> in our <hi>Mouths:</hi> the <hi>Arrows</hi> of Prayer are shot into Heaven with the Bowe of the Tongue. A <hi>Prayer</hi> should often be a <hi>Cry,</hi> and this, <hi>Going out from Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feigned Lips.</hi> Thus 'tis said in Hos. 14.2. <hi>Take with you words, and Turn
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:33759:10"/> Turn unto the Lord: Prayer</hi> should frequently become Articulate; and indeed a main part of the Homage due to God, from and for the <hi>Organs of Speech</hi> which He has gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven us, is to <hi>Articulate</hi> Prayer un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Him.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, For the <hi>Matter</hi> of Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, 'Tis <hi>Mercy to be obtained accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the pleasure of God.</hi> The Outcry of <hi>Prayer,</hi> is, for <hi>Mercy;</hi> the Language of it, is that in Psal. 51.1. <hi>Have mercy upon me, O God, according to thy Loving Kindness.</hi> But the <hi>Mercies</hi> of God for which our <hi>Prayer</hi> is to be concerned, are more particularly what the <hi>Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures</hi> of God have taught us to Implore. We are to <hi>Pray by Book;</hi> but it is the <hi>Bible</hi> that is our <hi>Prayer-Book.</hi> And the more <hi>special Platform of Prayer</hi> which our Lord has given us, in this Book; that I mean, which is commonly called, <hi>The Lords Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er;</hi> 'tis that which we are to make the more special Directory of our <hi>Prayers.</hi> We are a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#murp" extent="1 letter">

We should in our Prayers be content that God bestow His Blessings upon us, <hi>When He will,</hi> and, <hi>How He will,</hi> and, <hi>In what pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion He will:</hi> Our Prayers are to be <hi>Beggings,</hi> wherein we must own, <hi>'Tis not for us to know the Times or Seasons, nor may we Limit the Holy One of Israel!</hi>
                  </p>

                     <hi>What is the</hi> Restraint <hi>of this Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er?</hi>

                  <p>I Answer, <hi>The</hi> Restraint <hi>of Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, is the Omitting or Abating of such Prayer, as we are obliged unto.</hi>
                  </p>

When the People of God had so <hi>Restrained Prayer,</hi> it was by the Prophet said, in Dan. 9.13. <hi>We have not made our Prayer before the Lord our God.</hi> The <hi>Restraint</hi> of Prayer, is the <hi>Neglect</hi> of such Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er as is required in the Rule of Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er.

                     <hi>Fear of God?</hi> even that <hi>Fear,</hi> which is in the Oracles of Wisdom, so often Celebrated as, <hi>The Beginning of VVis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom?</hi> We read in Psal. 111.10. <hi>The Fear of the Lord, is the Beginning of Wisdom, and a good Understanding, have all they that do His Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</hi> Among the Things <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded</hi> by our God, there is none more Notable than that of <hi>Prayer;</hi> now 'tis the <hi>Fear of God,</hi> which helps men unto the <hi>Understanding,</hi> to <hi>do</hi> such a Thing. When it is here said, <hi>Thou hast cast off Fear,</hi> it is by some Translated so, <hi>Thou hast cast off Religion.</hi> The <hi>Fear of God,</hi> is a principle of <hi>Religion</hi> in the Heart of man; a principle of Respect unto the <hi>Commands</hi> and <hi>Praises</hi> of the Great God. It is an <hi>Old Testament Name,</hi> for the whole of <hi>Religion;</hi> but this <hi>Fear of God,</hi> includes a <hi>Love</hi> to God, a <hi>Faith</hi> on God, a <hi>Joy</hi> in God, as well as a <hi>Fear</hi> of Him.

Our God whose <hi>Throne</hi> is in the <hi>Highest Heavens,</hi> would be <hi>Enthroned</hi> in the <hi>High Thoughts</hi> of our Souls; now 'tis by Prayer that we are put upon the Forming of such God-A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doring <hi>Thoughts.</hi> It was said, of a very praying man, in <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.27. <hi>He saw Him, who is Invisible.</hi> In Prayer 'tis, that we, <hi>Lift up our Eyes,</hi> and so we have a more Distinct <hi>Sight</hi> of the <hi>Unseen</hi> God, in the seri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and suitable Thoughts of Him, so Raised in our minds.</p>
               <p>Again, Another End of <hi>Prayer,</hi> is, That we may reduce into Christian <hi>Practice,</hi> the chief <hi>Doctrines</hi> of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stianity. As now, to instance in
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:33759:15"/> one or two; There is the Doctrine of the <hi>Trinity</hi> in the <hi>Unity</hi> of the God-head; the Mystery of God beholding Himself with an Essential <hi>Perception,</hi> producing thence an Es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sential <hi>Satisfaction</hi> and so Three Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons in one God; This is a most profound <hi>Speculation!</hi> But in <hi>Prayer,</hi> this Incomprehensible Mystery, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes practically Observable and Applicable. 'Tis said in Eph. 2.18. <hi>Thro' Christ, we both have Access, by one Spirit unto the Father.</hi> Such a process of Soul-affairs there is in our <hi>Prayers:</hi> First, God the <hi>Father</hi> as a Judge, does by the <hi>Spirit of Bondage</hi> drive us to the Lord Jesus Christ, as our <hi>Mediator:</hi> and then, the Lord Jesus Christ, as our <hi>Mediator,</hi> does by the <hi>Spirit of Adoption</hi> carry us back to God, as our <hi>Father.</hi> So the Trinity becomes as clearly manifest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed unto us, as it was on the Banks of <hi>Jordan,</hi> to the Spectators of our Lords Baptism, whither <hi>Athanasius</hi> did of old send the <hi>Antitrinitarians.</hi> Thus, the whole <hi>Mediation</hi> of the
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:33759:15"/> Lord Jesus Christ, with all the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thods of Reconciliation between God and us, and many more such Illustrious <hi>Mysteries of Godliness,</hi> are most practically Illustrated in this piece of Godliness, our Prayer unto our God.</p>
               <p>Moreover; A Third End of <hi>Prayer</hi> is, That we may Express and Profess our <hi>Dependance</hi> on the God, who made us <hi>Depending Beings.</hi> What said the Psalmist? in Psal. 62.8. <hi>Trust in him at all Times, ye People.</hi> Well, but how shall <hi>People</hi> show their <hi>Trust</hi> in God? It follows, <hi>Pour out your Heart before him.</hi> Our Out-pou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red Souls in Prayer, declare, That we must ascribe to God, all that we have, all that we hope, all that we ask; that nothing is owing to any <hi>Blind Chance</hi> at all. When we do by Prayer go to God, <hi>That He would Give us our Daily Bread,</hi> We do thereby say, That our <hi>Bread</hi> is none of our own till He give it us. 'Tis Theevery to take any thing without the Owners Leave. Wherefore 'tis
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:33759:16"/> said, <hi>Every Thing is Sanctified by Prayer;</hi> why, by Prayer for every thing, we do say, <hi>That</hi> God is the Right <hi>Owner</hi> of that Thing; <hi>That</hi> we may not meddle with it, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept God will allow us to have it; Yea, <hi>That</hi> we cannot come at it at all, except God confer it upon us.</p>
               <p>Furthermore; A Fourth End of <hi>Prayer</hi> is, That we may nourish an Humble <hi>Communion</hi> with the God, who <hi>Humbles Himself</hi> to take No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of us. 'Tis in Prayer that we come to a marvellous <hi>Familiarity</hi> with the Lord our God, and ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rive to that priviledge in Job. 22.21. <hi>Acquaint now thy self with Him, and be at peace.</hi> The Intercourse be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Great God, and the Worms of the Dust, in this Exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise, is indeed most Inexpressible! Hence <hi>Prayer</hi> is called, <hi>A Visit un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to God;</hi> God and man becoming Friends, most <hi>Friendly Visits</hi> are in this way mutually given to one another. And this <hi>Communion</hi> with
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:33759:16"/> God, not only Emboldens our Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess to Him, while we <hi>Live;</hi> of our Neighbour 'tis said, <hi>Withdraw thy Foot from thy Neighbours House, Lest he be weary of thee, and so Hate thee;</hi> with our Maker 'tis not so; No, He tells us, <hi>The oftner you come, the more welcome to me!</hi> So it Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boldens our Retreat to God, when we <hi>Dy.</hi> Oh! that my Hearers would sufficiently Lay to Heart, what I am now going to say un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them! I say unto you, That it will be a Dreadful Thing for a Soul Departing to appear before a God whom it has altogether been a <hi>Stranger</hi> unto. A Devout Soul going before God, may Rejoyce with a most Heavenly Triumph, saying, <hi>My God, I know thee! This is the God, with whom I have spent many a good Hour, before my coming hither;</hi> much Prayer does procure for us, this Felicity! O but for a wicked Soul, at its Expiration to think, <hi>I am about meeting with a God, unto whom I never did in all m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#murp" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Once more; A Fifth End of <hi>Prayer</hi> is, That we may preserve such a <hi>good Order of Soul,</hi> as is neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary in order to our Happiness. It is said of some, in 2 Tim. 2.22. <hi>They call on the Lord, out of a pure Heart.</hi> It is by Prayer, wherein we <hi>Call upon the Lord,</hi> that the <hi>Heart</hi> is made <hi>pure</hi> and kept what it is made.

<pb n="31" facs="tcp:33759:18"/> speak unto <hi>our selves,</hi> when we so speak unto our God. When we <hi>Pray</hi> and say, <hi>Our Father which art in Heaven,</hi> we do after a sort <hi>Preach</hi> to our selves, and say, <hi>O my Soul, do thou Love and Serve, and Rely upon God, as thy Heavenly Father!</hi> When we say, <hi>Sanctify'd be thy Name,</hi> we <gap reason="illegible: left margin cropped or obscured" resp="#murp" extent="1+ letters">

                  <hi>Pet.</hi> 5.7. <hi>Cast all your care upon
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:33759:19"/> God:</hi> and it is Explained, in Phil. 4.6. <hi>Be careful for nothing, but in eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry thing by Prayer, and Supplication, with Thanksgiving, Let your Requests be made known unto God.</hi> By Prayer it is, that we Transmit our <hi>Care;</hi> and so we Interest our God in eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry thing that were otherwise too hard for us. When was it that the sorrowful <hi>Hannah</hi> became <hi>no more sad?</hi> It was when she had <hi>poured out her Soul unto the Lord.</hi> All unuttered <hi>Care,</hi> is like the Imprisoned <hi>Air;</hi> it makes a grievous Disturbance. When we have carried all our Cares unto God, by Prayer, we may come a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way with Triumphant Souls from the <hi>Throne of Grace,</hi> and Leave all our Troubles, all our Sorrows, all our Fears behind us there. Our <hi>Prayer</hi> will be our <hi>Hearts ease;</hi> and for this cause 'tis that our kind God, would be the <hi>God of our Prayer.</hi> Well, <hi>The Fear of God</hi> will never permit a man, to have a <hi>Low Esteem</hi> of such Inestimable Benefits. But,</p>
               <p>Secondly, If <hi>Prayer</hi> be Restrain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:33759:19"/> What good <hi>cause</hi> can be assign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for that <hi>Restraint?</hi> In truth, None but such as argues that men have cast off the <hi>Fear of God.</hi> As now,</p>
               <p>I am sure, Men don't <hi>Fear God,</hi> if they don't feel that they <hi>Want God.</hi> But this may be said of all <hi>Prayerless</hi> Ones. As they of old, in Jer. 2.3. <hi>They said, we are Lords, we will come no more at thee;</hi> so these; They say, <hi>We can do well enough without the Lord.</hi> They are not sensible of their own Weakness, their own Darkness, and their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual wretchedness without the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual Conduct of God.</p>
               <p>Again, I am sure, men don't <hi>Fear God,</hi> if they are not willing to <hi>Serve God.</hi> But this also may be said of all <hi>Prayerless</hi> Ones. As it was complained, in Isa. 43.22. <hi>Thou hast not called upon me, O Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cob, but hast been weary of me, O Israelâ–ª</hi> So when men are not eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Day <hi>Calling</hi> on God, they there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in proclaim themselves <hi>Weary</hi> of

               </p>
               <p>I add, It is by casting off the <hi>Fear of God,</hi> that men break thei<gap reason="illegible: right margin cropped or obscured" resp="#murp" extent="1+ letters">

                  <hi>Peace with God.</hi> Now if men<gap reason="illegible: right margin cropped or obscured" resp="#murp" extent="1+ letters">

                  </gap> their <hi>Prayer</hi> to God, would not be remitted. The Psalmist found it so, in Psal. 32.3. <hi>When I kept si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, my Bones waxed old, thro' my Roaring all the Day long.</hi> When our Prayers are <hi>silent,</hi> there is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably some <hi>Old Roaring</hi> Guilt Ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon us. Many complain, <hi>They do not, they cannot Pray; a Prayerless Drowsiness has overtaken them, and they know not what's the matter with them.</hi> Why, 'tis well if there be not some unrepented Sin upon you, Grieving the Holy Spirit of God; it is <hi>That</hi> which is a <hi>Quench-Prayer</hi> in your Souls.</p>
               <p>Lastly, What <hi>Fear of God</hi> can there be in them, that say, <hi>There

               <p>Well then, Let our <hi>Fears</hi> this Day Stimulate and Animate our <hi>Prayers;</hi> and let us therefore Entertain just <hi>Fears,</hi> that we may thereby Enliven our <hi>Prayers.</hi> Our <hi>Fear</hi> is this Day to deal with us, as <hi>Jonahs</hi> Master did by him; 'tis to come and say unto us, <hi>What meanest thou, O Sleep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er? Arise, and call upon thy God. Fear</hi> is a passion, which the All-wise God, who <hi>Forms the Spirit of man within him,</hi> has most wisely put into us. When that <hi>passion</hi> comes to be well placed and well acted, we then be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come highly <hi>Reasonable;</hi> when San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctified, we become Eminently <hi>Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous.</hi> That <hi>passion</hi> is the Engine which I would Employ this Afternoon, to fetch those <hi>Prayers</hi> wherein we now
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:33759:22"/> are, <hi>To pour out water before the Lord.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I am directed in Jude 23. <hi>Some Save with Fear.</hi> It is very certain, That we cannot be <hi>Saved</hi> without Importunate <hi>Prayer</hi> unto our God. <hi>Saved,</hi> said I? No, we cannot but be Destroy'd, but be Ruin'd, but be Plunged into inextricable Confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions. Well, 'tis by the <hi>Fear</hi> of this, that our <hi>Prayer</hi> should be now Invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorated.</p>
               <p>We read of an Angel, in Rev. 14.6, 7. <hi>An Angel Flying in the midst of Heaven, having the Everlasting Gospel, and saying with a Loud Voice, Fear God, and give Glory to Him, for the Hour of His Judgment is come; and worship Him!</hi> I shall endeavour so far to Imitate that Angel this After<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noon; that here I <hi>Stand</hi> in the <hi>midst</hi> of this Great Congregation, which make a little <hi>Heaven</hi> upon Earth; here I have the <hi>Everlasting Gospel</hi> in my Hand; and with a <hi>Loud Voice,</hi> I demand of you, to <hi>Fear God,</hi> because that <hi>Hour of his Judgment</hi> is now come upon the World; and Oh!

                  <hi>Fear</hi> Him so, as to give Him the <hi>Glory</hi> of the <hi>Worship,</hi> and especially of the <hi>Prayer,</hi> that is due unto Him.</p>
               <p>To speak more particularly,</p>
               <p n="1">
                  <hi>I.</hi> Let our <hi>Personal Fears,</hi> Restrain us from the Sin of <hi>Restraining</hi> those <hi>Personal Prayers,</hi> which God forbid, that any one <hi>Person</hi> among us all, should Live without. Are there no particular <hi>persons</hi> with us, who <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strain</hi> that Prayer, which the <hi>Fear of God</hi> calleth for? 'Tis to be <hi>Feared,</hi> that there are many such. 'Twere well, if most of us were as Innocent as <hi>Job</hi> was, of the Fault here Impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted unto <hi>Job.</hi> Alas, Here is an Indictment laid, <hi>For, that not having the Fear of God before thine Eyes, thou hast Restrained Prayer before God:</hi> But how many are there, who can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not plead, <hi>Not Guilty,</hi> to that Indict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment? Do they <hi>Pray?</hi> I wonder, For <hi>what</hi> it is? For <hi>Spiritual Bless<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings?</hi> No, they are the profane <hi>Esaus</hi> by whom such things are all Despi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed.
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:33759:23"/> For <hi>Temporal Blessings?</hi> No, they feed on such Fruits, without ever giving a <hi>Look</hi> up to the Tree from whence they fall. Do they <hi>Pray?</hi> I wonder, <hi>Where it is?</hi> In their <hi>Closets?</hi> No, They will <hi>Sin</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst God in Secret, but not in Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret <hi>Seek</hi> the Face of that God. In their <hi>Houses?</hi> No, They'l Eat there; Drink there, Smoke there, and Sin there, but not by Calling upon God there make <hi>Bethels</hi> of them. Do they <hi>Pray?</hi> I wonder <hi>When it is?</hi> Not in the <hi>Mornings;</hi> they are then in too much Haste of Business for it. Not in the <hi>Evenings;</hi> they are then too weary, too sleepy, too List<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less for it. But Let them now ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit of a few Expostulations with them.</p>
               <p>First. As for <hi>Prayer</hi> in your <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirements,</hi> Let <hi>Fear</hi> drive you to it. If the Angels of God, that are In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>visibly present at this Instant here, might become Audible to the whole Assembly, could they not point out incredibly many, one after another
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:33759:23"/> of us, and say, <hi>'Tis a good part of a week at least since those persons, were upon their Knees Retired for Secret Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er before the Lord!</hi> How few <hi>Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons</hi> are there, in <hi>Retirements,</hi> plying the Throne of Grace, for Divine <hi>Wisdom</hi> and <hi>Knowledge</hi> to be vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>safed unto them! How few <hi>Nehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miahs</hi> are there, in <hi>Retirements,</hi> Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seeching the God of Heaven to Bless all their Undertakings! How few <hi>Jacobs</hi> are there, in <hi>Retirements,</hi> Cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to God, that neither they, nor their Children, may miscarry! And how few <hi>Nathanaels! Nathanael</hi> knew what it was to be alone under a <hi>Fig tree,</hi> conversing with God; and our Lord said, of him, in Joh. 1.47. <hi>Beheld, An Israelite indeed, in whom is no Guile.</hi> But you that have no such a Retired Conversation with God, may then <hi>Fear,</hi> that you are not <hi>Israelites,</hi> that you are but <hi>Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crites,</hi> before Him. What saith our Lord? <hi>Pray to thy Father which is in Secret.</hi> So then, you that go with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out <hi>Secret Prayer</hi> from Day to Day,
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:33759:24"/> may <hi>Fear,</hi> whether God be your <hi>Father</hi> or no; but if God be not thy <hi>Father,</hi> man, what a <hi>Black Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi> hast thou? You are worse than <hi>Balaam</hi> himself, of whom 'tis re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported, <hi>That he went alone, to meet the Lord:</hi> and you may then <hi>Fear,</hi> that you shall never have <hi>Balaams</hi> wish, <hi>To Dy the Death of the Righteous.</hi> Yea, on the Day, when you go a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad without <hi>Secret Prayer,</hi> you may <hi>Fear</hi> what the Righteous God may Leave you to; to what Sins, what Plagues, the Justice of God may Leave you in that Cloudy Day. Such a Day to poor <hi>Origen,</hi> became the Day of his Lamentable Fall, at which all Ages have been since Amazed. That your <hi>Fear</hi> may be the more stirr'd, I'l Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port unto you, That an Ancient Professor belonging to this very Church, in whose House we are now together, after many years of good Repute with good people be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came a Drunken Sot, for which he was from this Holy Society Excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated.
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:33759:24"/> After the Censure, he fell into bitter Horrour and An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guish of Soul, and at length Dy'd in astonishing Circumstances; but some of his Dying Words were to this purpose; <hi>I often pray'd unto God, for a mercy, which He still Deny'd me; at Length I grew Angry at God: whereupon I grew slack in my Secret Prayers, and abated my Acquaintance with the Lord: ever since which, He hath dreadfully forsaken me, and I know that He hath now no mercy for me.</hi> Now, Let all Hear and <hi>Fear.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly. As for <hi>Prayer</hi> with your <hi>Families,</hi> Let <hi>Fear</hi> drive you to That also. There was an <hi>Earth-quake</hi> in <hi>Switzerland,</hi> that Shook down all the Houses in a Town, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept one piece of one House, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in a good man was then at <hi>Prayer</hi> with his Family. Suppose an <hi>Earth-quake</hi> in our <hi>Boston</hi> should quickly shake down all the Houses that have not <hi>Family Prayer</hi> constantly going in them, count me not uncharita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble for saying, <hi>I am Jealous there
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:33759:25"/> would be a very terrible Desolation!</hi> How few <hi>Ohed Edoms</hi> are there, that are with their <hi>Families</hi> paying a dai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Respect unto the <hi>Ark,</hi> the <hi>Christ</hi> of God? How few <hi>Cornelius's</hi> are there, that Calling their <hi>Families</hi> to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether more than once every day, do <hi>Pray in the midst of their Houses?</hi> How few Parents and Masters, do <hi>Continue in Prayer,</hi> with a frequency like that of the <hi>Continual Offering</hi> under the Law? And how few do like those in Math. 19.13. <hi>Bring their Little Ones</hi> unto the Lord Jesus Christ, that He may Bless them? You that thus do say unto the Most High, <hi>Depart from our Dwellings!</hi> may justly <hi>Fear</hi> lest by <hi>Death</hi> and <hi>Fire,</hi> He quickly Turn <hi>you</hi> out of them. Yea, you may <hi>Fear</hi> lest the <hi>Flying Roll</hi> o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#murp" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="45" facs="tcp:33759:25"/>
                  <hi>Fear,</hi> whose Houses are upon this Impious Account, <hi>Far from Fear?</hi> It is an eager and a raging pursuit after, <hi>the World,</hi> which thus Choaks the <hi>Family-Prayers</hi> of our Neighbour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood: But I would gladly be at the pains to write that Admonition, in Capitals, on the Walls of every such Habitation, WHAT IS A MAN PROFITED IF HE GAIN THE WHOLE WORLD, AND LOOSE HIS OWN SOUL! One would <hi>Fear</hi> to Live in the House of such a <hi>Philistin,</hi> whereof one may say, <hi>Sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly there is no Fear of God in this place.</hi> And one would think, the Owner of such an House may <hi>Fear</hi> the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verlasting Regret that will be upon him, when his Domesticks at last shall follow him, in the Fiery Burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Lake below, hideously Crying in his Ears, <hi>Why did you never teach us to pray? Your never praying with us, has brought us to this horrid place of Torment after you!</hi> But</p>
               <p>Thirdly, Let every manner of
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:33759:26"/>
                  <hi>Person</hi> be put upon all manner of <hi>Prayer,</hi> in the <hi>Fear</hi> of God.</p>
               <p>You might indeed upon this To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pick be argued with: <hi>Let the privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge and advantage of Prayer, inspire you with a very prayerful Disposition of Soul.</hi> The <hi>Priviledge</hi> of Prayer, how high is it! <hi>Prayer,</hi> it is, as we read in Heb. 1<gap reason="illegible" resp="#murp" extent="1 letter">

Our God has Assured us, in <hi>Isa.</hi> 45.19. <hi>I said not unto the Seed of Jacob, Seek ye me in vain.</hi> In vain! Truly No; most Gracious Lord; Thou hast said, <hi>Seek the Lord, and ye shall Live.</hi> There is in the Covenant of God, and <hi>Ensurance-Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice</hi>

Would we have our <hi>Souls,</hi> to be <hi>Blessed in very Deed?</hi> A <hi>Praying</hi> Soul, will be a <hi>Thriving</hi> Soul. Much <hi>Prayer,</hi> as it were keeps the Soul in a Breathing <hi>Sweat,</hi> which by Degrees does con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sume all the Distempers of it. In our <hi>Prayers,</hi> all our <hi>Graces</hi> come to be Exercised, and so to be Strength<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ened, so to be Perfected. <hi>Prayer,</hi> 'tis taken in 3 Joh. 2. for the <hi>Fair Wind,</hi> which will bring a <hi>Prosperous Voyage</hi> to the Heaven-born, Heaven-bound Soul. Again, A <hi>Praying</hi> Soul, will be a <hi>Joyful</hi> Soul When <hi>Daniels</hi> perplexities drave him to Prayer, there was that Cheering Message brought from Heaven unto him, in Dan. 10.23. <hi>Thou art greatly Beloved.</hi> There is an Island in the Mediterranean, whereof they say, The Sun will be sure to shine upon it once every every day throughout the year. Truly if you Pray much, you will be Likely thus to have the

                  <hi>Light of Gods Countenance</hi> upon you every day. Once more, A <hi>Praying</hi> Soul will be a <hi>Saved</hi> Soul. O the vast Gains of Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er! It is that whereof we are advised, in Rom. 10.13. <hi>Whosoever shall call on the Name of the Lord, shall be Saved.</hi> So then, Salvation, Spiritual and Eternal <hi>Salvation</hi> it self is ours, if we'll pray hard for that <hi>Salvation!</hi> Yet further; would we have our <hi>Bodies,</hi> our <hi>Estates,</hi> and all our <hi>Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fayrs,</hi> under the perpetual Blessings of Heaven? <hi>Prayer</hi> would befriend our U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niversal Welfare. These are the proffers of our God unto us, in Psal. 91.15. <hi>He shall call upon me, and I will deliver him, and Honour Him, and with Long Life will I satisfie him.</hi> When <hi>Saul</hi> perceived how much <hi>David</hi> was in Prayer, he said, <hi>Thou shalt do great Things.</hi> Thus to those of us, that are keeping the Wheel of <hi>Prayer</hi> in a perpetual motion, it may be said, <hi>Great Things are to be done for such a man!</hi> Finally, would we have Blessings to be Showred from on High upon our <hi>Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies?</hi> No Children are more known to be the <hi>Blessed of the Lord,</hi> than the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of the most <hi>Praying Parents:</hi> We cannot Lay up a better Portion for our Children, than a Stock of <hi>Prayers.</hi> Yea,
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:33759:28"/> By <hi>Prayerfulness</hi> we may not only <hi>Get</hi> Blessings, but <hi>Be</hi> Blessings too.

               <p>But if none of <hi>This</hi> move you, then let <hi>Fear</hi> do it.

               <p n="2">
                  <hi>II</hi> Let us not <hi>Cast off</hi> those <hi>General Fears,</hi> that should prevent the <hi>Restraint</hi> of those <hi>General Prayers,</hi> which ought generally to be going every where a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong us. I need not quote <hi>Nazian<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zen</hi> as my Authority for that Asserti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, <hi>That there is nothing so Fearful as to be without Fear.</hi> But I will add, That our being without <hi>Fear,</hi> will ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der us without <hi>Prayer,</hi> and then our Condition would be <hi>Fearful</hi> indeed un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Extremity. Wherefore, in one word, O Let not FEARLESS and

               </p>
               <p>This <hi>Fearless</hi> and <hi>Prayerless</hi> Temper, (<hi>Distemper,</hi> I should rather say,) is that SECURITY, which is the usual Fore-runner of the most Horrible De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solations. Tho' <hi>Job</hi> could say, <hi>The Thing which I greatly Feared is come up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on me,</hi> yet with us it is mostly other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise; The Thing which we <hi>Least Fear</hi> is most Likely to come upon us; and the Thing is then most Ready to come, when we do <hi>Least Fear</hi> it. Mark what I say, You cannot in all the Book of God, pitch upon any Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple Remarkably secure, but presently you'l find a Remakable Stroke of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, in Judgment upon those unhappy Sleepers. When the <hi>Old World</hi> was Drowned in Security, then 'twas that their <hi>Foundation was Overflown with a Flood.</hi> And so still 'tis, in <hi>Our</hi> World; That men are never so near cutting in pieces, as when they sing, <hi>The Bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terness of Death is over!</hi> See 1 Thes. 5.3. Indeed I cannot easily, forbear the Outcry, which Honest <hi>G. Parisiensis</hi> made Long ago; <hi>O Security! Thou

               </p>
               <p>Particularly,</p>
               <p>First, <hi>Let not Fear be east off:</hi> Are we not <hi>Afraid,</hi> Lest the <hi>Confusions</hi> which are to over-set and overwhelm, the whole World, in these Latter Dayes, do <hi>Come hither</hi> also.

And what? Is that <hi>Kingdom</hi> of our Lord so Loved, so Studied, so Embraced among our selves, that we need not Fear being reached by that astonishing <hi>Wo?</hi> I would to God it were so.

<pb n="55" facs="tcp:33759:30"/> are to be <hi>Refreshed by the presence of the Lord,</hi> yet it will be a <hi>woful</hi> Day for them that <hi>Know not God, and obey not His Gospel.</hi> The Fields will grow loth to nourish those Rebels; <hi>There shall be Famines.</hi> The Air will grow Loth to let them Breathe; <hi>There shall be Pestilences.</hi> The Eyes of Heaven will grow loth to behold them: <hi>The Lights of Heaven shall be Darkened.</hi> The Earth will grown under the Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den of them; <hi>There shall be Earth-quakes in divers places.</hi> There is to be Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted indeed, a further Accomplishment of that word, in Heb. 12.26. <hi>Yet once more, I Shake, not the Earth only, but Heaven also.</hi> It is a Day of <hi>Earthquakes,</hi> and should it not be a Day of <hi>Heart-quakes</hi> too? Literal and Natural <hi>Earth-quakes</hi> are like to be multiplied in the approaching Age. The Subterranean <hi>Fires</hi> that are shortly to assist the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flagration of this Globe, will get head apace, and <hi>Earth-quakes</hi> more stupen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dous than the Late one upon our mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serable Neighbours, will be thereby occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sioned. As it was with a Burning Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, that our God gave out His <hi>Law</hi> unto the Jewish World, so He terrify'd the World, with another Burning Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain,
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:33759:31"/> when He gave out His <hi>Gospel</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Gentile World. Throughout <hi>Europe</hi> and <hi>Asia</hi> and <hi>Africa,</hi> people were then filled with Horrid Conster<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations, at the Fiery Eruptions of Mount <hi>Vesuvius,</hi> as the Historians of those Times Report unto us. Why, our God is now coming to Judge the World for the Contempt of His <hi>Law,</hi> and of His <hi>Gospel;</hi> and He will in a more affrighting manner set the World in a Burning <hi>Fire,</hi> at His Coming: <hi>A Fire shall devour before Him, and it shall be very Tempestuous round about Him.</hi> Proper <hi>Earthquakes,</hi> will probably abound in the Near Advances of That <hi>Notable Day of the Lord.</hi> But be sure, <hi>Meta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phorical Earthquakes,</hi> there will be E-now; State-quakes, Church-quakes, Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion-quakes, will now Rage at a migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty rate As <hi>Jonah</hi> ran through <hi>Nini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ve,</hi> proclaiming, <hi>Yet Forty Days and the Great City shall be Overthrown.</hi> So do I now run thro' <hi>New-England,</hi> and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claim, <hi>There is a Great City going to be Overthrown; and yet within less than Twenty Years, the greatest Shakes are like to be given unto the World, that ever happened from the first Foundation of it.</hi>

               <pb n="57" facs="tcp:33759:31"/>
               <p>Secondly. <hi>Let not Fear be cast off:</hi> Are we not <hi>Afraid,</hi> Lest when the <hi>Storms</hi> of Divine Vengeance do burst and break upon our own Sinful Nation, some <hi>Drops</hi> of the Storms do fall up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <hi>our</hi> Heads. The Profanity, the Debauchery, the Superstition, wherewith our Nation has been infected, have Long been making a Loud Cry in the Ears of the <hi>Lord God of Sabaoth;</hi> So that he seems to say, as in Jer. 5.9. <hi>Shall not I visit for these things, saith the Lord: Shall not my Soul be avenged on such a Nation as this?</hi> And when the Holy God shall <hi>visit</hi> for those things, it will be well, if <hi>Showers</hi> of <hi>Blood</hi> be not Rained on a Land, where the <hi>Blood</hi> of His Dear Son has been treated as an <hi>Æ²nholy Thing.</hi> Hence 'tis that many Thinking Men, in the Nation at this Day, are Looking upon one another with paleness in their Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesâ–ª and wishing, <hi>O that we had Wings like a Dove!</hi> But especially, when they Look back upon the fierce <hi>Persecutions,</hi> which formerly flamed in that Land against the Pure Worship of our Lord, they conceive that they may see, <hi>Wrath coming unto the uttermost.</hi> And how
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:33759:32"/> shall a share in that <hi>Wrath</hi> upon the <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,</hi> be now avoided, by the most Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembling of all her <hi>Daughters?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly. <hi>Let not Fear be cast off:</hi> Are we not <hi>Afraid,</hi> Lest the <hi>Cup</hi> of that <hi>Fury,</hi> which has already dissipated as Glorious <hi>Churches</hi> as any of <hi>Ours,</hi> be likewise given unto <hi>ours.</hi> We have most Appalling In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timations given unto us, not only in the Wasting and the Doleful Disasters that have come upon the other Plantations of the English <hi>America;</hi> such Disasters as cause the most considerable Personages a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong them, to write from thence unto us, <hi>The Divine Providence almost seems to have forsaken this side of the World, and Left us unto the Treasures of Wrath, which we have been Long Laying up!</hi> But also in the <hi>Scatterings,</hi> that have elsewhere befallen, <hi>The Holy People.</hi> VVe may value our selves upon our Ecclesiastical <hi>Settlements</hi> &amp; <hi>Ornaments,</hi> &amp; upon the wonderful Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearances of God, in the first production of them; whereof a CHURCH HIS<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TORY, might indeed most profitably be [and is] Endeavoured Yea, but our Lord may say unto us, <hi>I have not found thy Works perfect before God!</hi> And who
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:33759:32"/> can say, How far that Holy God, may proceed in punishing us, <hi>yet seven times more for our Iniquities?</hi> in punishing us, <hi>above the Rest of the Families of the Earth?</hi> VVhen we see what has befallen others, our Lord says to us, as in Luc. 13.3, 5. <hi>Except ye Repent, ye shall all Likewise pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish.</hi> Let me then say to you, <hi>Go to Shi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loh!</hi> and again, <hi>Go to Asia!</hi> and once more, <hi>Go to the European Churches!</hi> espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially Go to <hi>France,</hi> where the greatest Scourge of the VVorld, more than seven years ago, coined <hi>Medals,</hi> on which 'twas brag'd, <hi>That he had then Reduced no less than twenty Hundred Thousand Calvinists, from the Protestant Religion.</hi> A worse, thing surely than the Cutting of so many Throats! Behold, the VVarnings of God unto <hi>Æ²s</hi> in these Ends of the Earth, by <hi>the Desolations thus made in the Earth.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Fourthly. <hi>Let not Fear he east off:</hi> Are we not <hi>Afraid,</hi> Lest we come our selves to <hi>See,</hi> the mischiefs which our Ancient <hi>Seers</hi> have often foretold unto us. Every <hi>Wise man,</hi> is a <hi>Prophet:</hi> VVe have had such <hi>Wise men,</hi> on many Opportunities, especially some Anniversary Ones, here <hi>Prophesying,</hi> I assure you, <hi>No Smooth things</hi> unto us: in all which, it has not been a
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:33759:33"/> rash <hi>Enthusiasm,</hi> it has been <hi>Scripture,</hi> it has been <hi>Reason,</hi> that has Inspired them. They have done according to their Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission, in Isa. 58.1. <hi>Lift up thy voice like a Trumpet.</hi> And what has been the <hi>Voice of the Trumpet?</hi> Not <hi>Æ²ncertain,</hi> but Universally concurring in this thing. <hi>Reformation, or Desolation! Reformation, or Desolation!</hi> and, I pray, where do we find much of the demanded <hi>Reformation?</hi> Besides this, our <hi>Old</hi> Men, without any vain <hi>Dreams,</hi> have made their moral Prog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nostications upon our manners. VVe have had an <hi>Hooker,</hi> long since Prophesy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing unto us,, <hi>That God would punish the Wanton Spirit of the Professors in this Country, with a sad want of Able men, in all Orders among them.</hi> VVe have had a <hi>Shepard,</hi> long since Prophesying unto us, <hi>That such a Dismal Night was towards us, and such sore Afflictions, as would fill our Hearts with an Anguish equal to the worst, in any of our Forefathers Days.</hi> VVe have had a <hi>Norton,</hi> Sighing over us, <hi>What is the Counsel of the Lord concerning the Churches of New-England, is a matter of solemn and awful Meditation.</hi> And some other persons, not inferiour, have not stuck to say, <hi>We fear the Gospel will g<gap reason="illegible" resp="#murp" extent="1 letter">

                     <pb n="61" facs="tcp:33759:33"/> the Lord Jesus will depart from these Coasts, within a little while.</hi> Let thy Heart ake, O <hi>New-England,</hi> Lest this <hi>Day of thy Watchmen</hi> come upon theeâ–ª</p>
               <p>Fifthly. <hi>Let not Fear be cast off:</hi> Are we not <hi>Afraid,</hi> Lest our Unreformed <hi>Iniquities,</hi> bring down upon us, most Irretrievable <hi>Calamities.</hi> What are our <hi>Iniquities?</hi> Even those very Crimes for which, 'tis said, <hi>The Wrath of the Lord arose against His People</hi> of Old, <hi>until there was no Remedy</hi> You have them, in 2 Chron. 36.14, 16. First, <hi>The People Transgressed very much, after all the Abominations of the Heathen.</hi> And have not we shamefully <hi>Indianized,</hi> by being one of the most <hi>Lying</hi> (if not like the Indians, also the most <hi>Idle</hi>) People almost in the Universe? Again, <hi>They polluted the House of the Lord.</hi> And have not the Scandalous, Damnable, Miscarriages in multitudes of our <hi>Church-Members</hi> done so too? Or, is not the cursed Contempt cast upon the <hi>Table</hi> of the Lord by such multitudes as Turn their Backs thereupon, a further doing so? Once more, <hi>They misused the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets.</hi> And how feelingly might many
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:33759:34"/> of our Discourag'd, Revil'd, Cheated and Starved <hi>Ministers</hi> complain of such Usage, if they Lov'd Complaining? Yea, may not we <hi>Boston,</hi> even call <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom</hi> our Sister, for our <hi>Pride,</hi> our <hi>Ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of Bread,</hi> our <hi>Abundance of Idleness,</hi> and our <hi>Oppression of one another?</hi> See whether thy Face, O Town <hi>Once</hi> (and well if not justly <hi>still!</hi>) called <hi>Lost Town,</hi> to hers, be not, <hi>Qualis decet esse Sororum!</hi> For my part, I freely confess, my particular Indisposition to be mov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by many things that are often ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted, <hi>Prodigies;</hi> but this I say; These <hi>Iniquities</hi> are the worst of <hi>Prodigies.</hi> A thousand <hi>Comets</hi> Blazing over our Heads, or views of <hi>Armies</hi> Fighting in the <hi>Air,</hi> would be less Cloudy Premoniti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of Impending Evils, than these <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digious Iniquities.</hi> But that which heigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tens the <hi>Prodigy</hi> is this; That some of our Faults have most <hi>Naturally</hi> a Ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency to Ruine us. I speak not of our <hi>Contention:</hi> tho' what can be <hi>Naturally</hi> consequent upon it, unless This, <hi>That when many Little Birds are pecking at one another, the Kite may prey upon them all?</hi> But I'l speak of our <hi>Ingratitude.</hi> It is well known, That the greatest Instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:33759:34"/> of Saving the <hi>Lands,</hi> the <hi>Lives,</hi> the most precious <hi>Liberties</hi> of this People, are acknowledged but with the worst of Abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses for all their Services; cruel <hi>Malice</hi> and <hi>Slander,</hi> is now commonly known by the Name of <hi>Country-Pay</hi> for the most of them that Lay this People under the most Eternal Obligations. What now can follow <hi>Naturally,</hi> but this; That our <hi>Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red Benefactors,</hi> will make all the sensible part of Mankind joyn with them in say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>We will never be the Healers of such a People!</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Sixthly, <hi>Let not Fear be cast off:</hi> Are we not <hi>Afraid,</hi> Lest <hi>Indian Hatchets</hi> are to fetch yet more Blows at the <hi>Root of our Tree?</hi> When the <hi>Philistines</hi> bore hard upon <hi>Saul,</hi> 'tis said, <hi>His Armour bearer was sore afraid:</hi> and what shall <hi>we</hi> be, that are surrounded with Bloody <hi>Philistines?</hi> Our God has been doing to us what He denounced, in Deut. 31.25. <hi>I will move them to Jealousie with those who are not a People. I will provoke them to Anger with a Foolish Nation.</hi> And those <hi>Foolish Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons</hi> that yet Survive of that <hi>No People,</hi> seem Reserved for a further Scourge unto us, who have been so <hi>Foolish,</hi> as to neglect ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry much of the <hi>Gospellizing</hi> of those <hi>Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</hi>

But the most of our Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, seem to <hi>Blow</hi> upon such Underta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kings; or at least, have no <hi>Spirit</hi> for it: So that if Good Old <hi>Gildas</hi> were alive a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong us, he would threaten us, as he did his Country-men, when he told them, <hi>That God would make the Pagan</hi> Saxons, <hi>an heavy plague unto them, for their doing so Little towards the Conversion of those mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serable Pagans.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Seventhly. <hi>Let not Fear be cast off:</hi> Are we not <hi>Afraid,</hi> Lest the <hi>Great Wrath</hi> of the Devil which hath been upon us, do remain for more than a <hi>Short Time</hi> among
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:33759:36"/> us. I Remember, 'tis affirm'd by <hi>Claber Radulphus,</hi> That about the Time, when <hi>Antichrist</hi> was breaking in upon the World, People were scared almost out of their Wits, with a Fiery <hi>Dragon,</hi> seen sometimes to Fly about the Air. Truly, That Fiery <hi>Dragon,</hi> the Devil, has been most sensibly Flying about us, within this year or two, in the matchless <hi>Exchant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments</hi> and <hi>Possessions,</hi> that have abounded in our Neighbourhood. But into what <hi>Passions,</hi> into what <hi>Mistakes,</hi> into what E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>normous <hi>Disorders,</hi> has this <hi>Descent of the Devil</hi> precipitated us, instead of <hi>driving</hi> us, to a more Trembling <hi>Walk with God?</hi> The <hi>Evil Angels</hi> being now so much ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted off as they are, 'tis well if the n<gap reason="illegible" resp="#murp" extent="1 letter">

               </p>
               <p>Lastly. <hi>Let not Fear be cast off:</hi> Are we not <hi>Afraid,</hi> Lest the <hi>Rising Generation</hi> here, do Barbarously Degenerate into the <hi>Plant of a strange Vine?</hi> There is indeed nothing to be more dreaded among us, than that thing, in Judg. 2.10. <hi>There a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rose another Generation, which knew not the Lord, nor yet the Works which He had done.</hi> Alas, Alas!

Shall we then <hi>perish?</hi> No, That we shall not; if we now do, by our Prayers <hi>Awaken</hi> our Lord unto the Sav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of us.</p>
               <p>But after all; when the worst comes to the worst: Yet, <hi>Surely I know it shall be well with them that fear God, that Fear before Him.</hi> Let us have much of that <hi>Fear</hi> within us, and let that Swallow

                     </gap>um omnia timent.</hi> The <hi>Fear</hi> of God will give usâ–ª Room among His <hi>Alamoth,</hi> or His Hidden Ones; and then we may without <hi>Fear</hi> Sing the <hi>Forty Sixth Psalm,</hi> which <hi>Luther</hi> used, when Things Look'd with a bad face abroad; Sing, <hi>We will not Fear, tho' the Earth be removed, and tho' the Mountain be carried into the midst of the Sea.</hi> Our God, is now, I believe, upon the <hi>Resurrection</hi> of His <hi>Witnesses:</hi> altho' former Attempts about that <hi>Resur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection</hi> have been Abortive, yet now, <hi>with His Dead Body they shall arise.</hi> It is therefore likely to be a Day of more than ordinary <hi>Indignation</hi> upon an Impious World; but if we are now fitted and acted by the <hi>Fear</hi> of God, and if that <hi>Fear</hi> carry us forth to to all due <hi>Testimonies</hi> for His Truths and Ways, He will say unto us, <hi>Come, My People; Enter thou into thy Chambers, and Shut thy Doors about thee.</hi>
